# Hookify Extensions

## Overview

# Hookify Plugin

Easily create custom hooks to prevent unwanted behaviors by analyzing conversation patterns or from explicit instructions.

## Overview

The hookify plugin makes it simple to create hooks without editing complex `hook-config.json` files. Instead, you create lightweight markdown configuration files that define patterns to watch for and messages to show when those patterns match.

**Key features:**
- 🎯 Analyze conversations to find unwanted behaviors automatically
- 📝 Simple markdown configuration files with YAML frontmatter
- 🔍 Regex pattern matching for powerful rules
- 🚀 No coding required - just describe the behavior
- 🔄 Easy enable/disable without restarting

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your First Rule

```bash
/hookify Warn me when I use rm -rf commands
```

This analyzes your request and creates `.agent/hookify.warn-rm.local.md`.

### 2. Test It Immediately

**No restart needed!** Rules take effect on the very next tool use.

Ask Claude to run a command that should trigger the rule:
```
Run rm -rf /tmp/test
```

You should see the warning message immediately!

## Usage

### Main Command: /hookify

**With arguments:**
```
/hookify Don't use console.log in TypeScript files
```
Creates a rule from your explicit instructions.

**Without arguments:**
```
/hookify
```
Analyzes recent conversation to find behaviors you've corrected or been frustrated by.

### Helper Commands

**List all rules:**
```
/hookify:list
```

**Configure rules interactively:**
```
/hookify:configure
```
Enable/disable existing rules through an interactive interface.

**Get help:**
```
/hookify:help
```

## Rule Configuration Format

### Simple Rule (Single Pattern)

`.agent/hookify.dangerous-rm.local.md`:
```markdown
---
name: block-dangerous-rm
enabled: true
event: bash
pattern: rm\s+-rf
action: block
---

⚠️ **Dangerous rm command detected!**

This command could delete important files. Please:
- Verify the path is correct
- Consider using a safer approach
- Make sure you have backups
```

**Action field:**
- `warn`: Shows warning but allows operation (default)
- `block`: Prevents operation from executing (PreToolUse) or stops session (Stop events)

### Advanced Rule (Multiple Conditions)

`.agent/hookify.sensitive-files.local.md`:
```markdown
---
name: warn-sensitive-files
enabled: true
event: file
action: warn
conditions:
  - field: file_path
    operator: regex_match
    pattern: \.env$|credentials|secrets
  - field: new_text
    operator: contains
    pattern: KEY
---

🔐 **Sensitive file edit detected!**

Ensure credentials are not hardcoded and file is in .gitignore.
```

**All conditions must match** for the rule to trigger.

## Event Types

- **`bash`**: Triggers on Bash tool commands
- **`file`**: Triggers on Edit, Write, MultiEdit tools
- **`stop`**: Triggers when Claude wants to stop (for completion checks)
- **`prompt`**: Triggers on user prompt submission
- **`all`**: Triggers on all events

## Pattern Syntax

Use Python regex syntax:

| Pattern | Matches | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `rm\s+-rf` | rm -rf | rm -rf /tmp |
| `console\.log\(` | console.log( | console.log("test") |
| `(eval\|exec)\(` | eval( or exec( | eval("code") |
| `\.env$` | files ending in .env | .env, .env.local |
| `chmod\s+777` | chmod 777 | chmod 777 file.txt |

**Tips:**
- Use `\s` for whitespace
- Escape special chars: `\.` for literal dot
- Use `|` for OR: `(foo|bar)`
- Use `.*` to match anything
- Set `action: block` for dangerous operations
- Set `action: warn` (or omit) for informational warnings

## Examples

### Example 1: Block Dangerous Commands

```markdown
---
name: block-destructive-ops
enabled: true
event: bash
pattern: rm\s+-rf|dd\s+if=|mkfs|format
action: block
---

🛑 **Destructive operation detected!**

This command can cause data loss. Operation blocked for safety.
Please verify the exact path and use a safer approach.
```

**This rule blocks the operation** - Claude will not be allowed to execute these commands.

### Example 2: Warn About Debug Code

```markdown
---
name: warn-debug-code
enabled: true
event: file
pattern: console\.log\(|debugger;|print\(
action: warn
---

🐛 **Debug code detected**

Remember to remove debugging statements before committing.
```

**This rule warns but allows** - Claude sees the message but can still proceed.

### Example 3: Require Tests Before Stopping

```markdown
---
name: require-tests-run
enabled: false
event: stop
action: block
conditions:
  - field: transcript
    operator: not_contains
    pattern: npm test|pytest|cargo test
---

**Tests not detected in transcript!**

Before stopping, please run tests to verify your changes work correctly.
```

**This blocks Claude from stopping** if no test commands appear in the session transcript. Enable only when you want strict enforcement.

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Conditions

Check multiple fields simultaneously:

```markdown
---
name: api-key-in-typescript
enabled: true
event: file
conditions:
  - field: file_path
    operator: regex_match
    pattern: \.tsx?$
  - field: new_text
    operator: regex_match
    pattern: (API_KEY|SECRET|TOKEN)\s*=\s*["']
---

🔐 **Hardcoded credential in TypeScript!**

Use environment variables instead of hardcoded values.
```

### Operators Reference

- `regex_match`: Pattern must match (most common)
- `contains`: String must contain pattern
- `equals`: Exact string match
- `not_contains`: String must NOT contain pattern
- `starts_with`: String starts with pattern
- `ends_with`: String ends with pattern

### Field Reference

**For bash events:**
- `command`: The bash command string

**For file events:**
- `file_path`: Path to file being edited
- `new_text`: New content being added (Edit, Write)
- `old_text`: Old content being replaced (Edit only)
- `content`: File content (Write only)

**For prompt events:**
- `user_prompt`: The user's submitted prompt text

**For stop events:**
- Use general matching on session state

## Management

### Enable/Disable Rules

**Temporarily disable:**
Edit the `.local.md` file and set `enabled: false`

**Re-enable:**
Set `enabled: true`

**Or use interactive tool:**
```
/hookify:configure
```

### Delete Rules

Simply delete the `.local.md` file:
```bash
rm .agent/hookify.my-rule.local.md
```

### View All Rules

```
/hookify:list
```

## Installation

This plugin is part of the coding assistant Marketplace. It should be auto-discovered when the marketplace is installed.

**Manual testing:**
```bash
cc --plugin-dir /path/to/hookify
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- No external dependencies (uses stdlib only)

## Troubleshooting

**Rule not triggering:**
1. Check rule file exists in `.agent/` directory (in project root, not plugin directory)
2. Verify `enabled: true` in frontmatter
3. Test regex pattern separately
4. Rules should work immediately - no restart needed
5. Try `hookify:list` to see if rule is loaded

**Import errors:**
- Ensure Python 3 is available: `python3 --version`
- Check hookify plugin is installed

**Pattern not matching:**
- Test regex: `python3 -c "import re; print(re.search(r'pattern', 'text'))"`
- Use unquoted patterns in YAML to avoid escaping issues
- Start simple, then add complexity

**Hook seems slow:**
- Keep patterns simple (avoid complex regex)
- Use specific event types (bash, file) instead of "all"
- Limit number of active rules

## Future Enhancements

- Severity levels (error/warning/info distinctions)
- Rule templates library
- Interactive pattern builder
- Hook testing utilities
- JSON format support (in addition to markdown)

## Commands / Workflows

### Command: `/configure`
*Description*: Enable or disable hookify rules interactively

# Configure Hookify Rules

**Load hookify:writing-rules skill first** to understand rule format.

Enable or disable existing hookify rules using an interactive interface.

## Steps

### 1. Find Existing Rules

Use Glob tool to find all hookify rule files:
```
pattern: ".agent/hookify.*.local.md"
```

If no rules found, inform user:
```
No hookify rules configured yet. Use `hookify` to create your first rule.
```

### 2. Read Current State

For each rule file:
- Read the file
- Extract `name` and `enabled` fields from frontmatter
- Build list of rules with current state

### 3. Ask User Which Rules to Toggle

Use AskUserQuestion to let user select rules:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Which rules would you like to enable or disable?",
      "header": "Configure",
      "multiSelect": true,
      "options": [
        {
          "label": "warn-dangerous-rm (currently enabled)",
          "description": "Warns about rm -rf commands"
        },
        {
          "label": "warn-console-log (currently disabled)",
          "description": "Warns about console.log in code"
        },
        {
          "label": "require-tests (currently enabled)",
          "description": "Requires tests before stopping"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Option format:**
- Label: `{rule-name} (currently {enabled|disabled})`
- Description: Brief description from rule's message or pattern

### 4. Parse User Selection

For each selected rule:
- Determine current state from label (enabled/disabled)
- Toggle state: enabled → disabled, disabled → enabled

### 5. Update Rule Files

For each rule to toggle:
- Use Read tool to read current content
- Use Edit tool to change `enabled: true` to `enabled: false` (or vice versa)
- Handle both with and without quotes

**Edit pattern for enabling:**
```
old_string: "enabled: false"
new_string: "enabled: true"
```

**Edit pattern for disabling:**
```
old_string: "enabled: true"
new_string: "enabled: false"
```

### 6. Confirm Changes

Show user what was changed:

```
## Hookify Rules Updated

**Enabled:**
- warn-console-log

**Disabled:**
- warn-dangerous-rm

**Unchanged:**
- require-tests

Changes apply immediately - no restart needed
```

## Important Notes

- Changes take effect immediately on next tool use
- You can also manually edit .agent/hookify.*.local.md files
- To permanently remove a rule, delete its .local.md file
- Use `hookify:list` to see all configured rules

## Edge Cases

**No rules to configure:**
- Show message about using `hookify` to create rules first

**User selects no rules:**
- Inform that no changes were made

**File read/write errors:**
- Inform user of specific error
- Suggest manual editing as fallback

### Command: `help`
*Description*: Get help with the hookify plugin

# Hookify Plugin Help

Explain how the hookify plugin works and how to use it.

## Overview

The hookify plugin makes it easy to create custom hooks that prevent unwanted behaviors. Instead of editing `hook-config.json` files, users create simple markdown configuration files that define patterns to watch for.

## How It Works

### 1. Hook System

Hookify installs generic hooks that run on these events:
- **PreToolUse**: Before any tool executes (Bash, Edit, Write, etc.)
- **PostToolUse**: After a tool executes
- **Stop**: When Claude wants to stop working
- **UserPromptSubmit**: When user submits a prompt

These hooks read configuration files from `.agent/hookify.*.local.md` and check if any rules match the current operation.

### 2. Configuration Files

Users create rules in `.agent/hookify.{rule-name}.local.md` files:

```markdown
---
name: warn-dangerous-rm
enabled: true
event: bash
pattern: rm\s+-rf
---

⚠️ **Dangerous rm command detected!**

This command could delete important files. Please verify the path.
```

**Key fields:**
- `name`: Unique identifier for the rule
- `enabled`: true/false to activate/deactivate
- `event`: bash, file, stop, prompt, or all
- `pattern`: Regex pattern to match

The message body is what Claude sees when the rule triggers.

### 3. Creating Rules

**Option A: Use /hookify command**
```
/hookify Don't use console.log in production files
```

This analyzes your request and creates the appropriate rule file.

**Option B: Create manually**
Create `.agent/hookify.my-rule.local.md` with the format above.

**Option C: Analyze conversation**
```
/hookify
```

Without arguments, hookify analyzes recent conversation to find behaviors you want to prevent.

## Available Commands

- **`hookify`** - Create hooks from conversation analysis or explicit instructions
- **`hookify:help`** - Show this help (what you're reading now)
- **`hookify:list`** - List all configured hooks
- **`hookify:configure`** - Enable/disable existing hooks interactively

## Example Use Cases

**Prevent dangerous commands:**
```markdown
---
name: block-chmod-777
enabled: true
event: bash
pattern: chmod\s+777
---

Don't use chmod 777 - it's a security risk. Use specific permissions instead.
```

**Warn about debugging code:**
```markdown
---
name: warn-console-log
enabled: true
event: file
pattern: console\.log\(
---

Console.log detected. Remember to remove debug logging before committing.
```

**Require tests before stopping:**
```markdown
---
name: require-tests
enabled: true
event: stop
pattern: .*
---

Did you run tests before finishing? Make sure `npm test` or equivalent was executed.
```

## Pattern Syntax

Use Python regex syntax:
- `\s` - whitespace
- `\.` - literal dot
- `|` - OR
- `+` - one or more
- `*` - zero or more
- `\d` - digit
- `[abc]` - character class

**Examples:**
- `rm\s+-rf` - matches "rm -rf"
- `console\.log\(` - matches "console.log("
- `(eval|exec)\(` - matches "eval(" or "exec("
- `\.env$` - matches files ending in .env

## Important Notes

**No Restart Needed**: Hookify rules (`.local.md` files) take effect immediately on the next tool use. The hookify hooks are already loaded and read your rules dynamically.

**Block or Warn**: Rules can either `block` operations (prevent execution) or `warn` (show message but allow). Set `action: block` or `action: warn` in the rule's frontmatter.

**Rule Files**: Keep rules in `.agent/hookify.*.local.md` - they should be git-ignored (add to .gitignore if needed).

**Disable Rules**: Set `enabled: false` in frontmatter or delete the file.

## Troubleshooting

**Hook not triggering:**
- Check rule file is in `.agent/` directory
- Verify `enabled: true` in frontmatter
- Confirm pattern is valid regex
- Test pattern: `python3 -c "import re; print(re.search('your_pattern', 'test_text'))"`
- Rules take effect immediately - no restart needed

**Import errors:**
- Check Python 3 is available: `python3 --version`
- Verify hookify plugin is installed correctly

**Pattern not matching:**
- Test regex separately
- Check for escaping issues (use unquoted patterns in YAML)
- Try simpler pattern first, then refine

## Getting Started

1. Create your first rule:
   ```
   /hookify Warn me when I try to use rm -rf
   ```

2. Try to trigger it:
   - Ask Claude to run `rm -rf /tmp/test`
   - You should see the warning

4. Refine the rule by editing `.agent/hookify.warn-rm.local.md`

5. Create more rules as you encounter unwanted behaviors

For more examples, check the `PLUGIN_ROOT/examples/` directory.

### Command: `hookify`
*Description*: Create hooks to prevent unwanted behaviors from conversation analysis or explicit instructions

# Hookify - Create Hooks from Unwanted Behaviors

**FIRST: Load the hookify:writing-rules skill** using the Skill tool to understand rule file format and syntax.

Create hook rules to prevent problematic behaviors by analyzing the conversation or from explicit user instructions.

## Your Task

You will help the user create hookify rules to prevent unwanted behaviors. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Gather Behavior Information

**If $ARGUMENTS is provided:**
- User has given specific instructions: `$ARGUMENTS`
- Still analyze recent conversation (last 10-15 user messages) for additional context
- Look for examples of the behavior happening

**If $ARGUMENTS is empty:**
- Launch the conversation-analyzer agent to find problematic behaviors
- Agent will scan user prompts for frustration signals
- Agent will return structured findings

**To analyze conversation:**
Use the Task tool to launch conversation-analyzer agent:
```
{
  "subagent_type": "general-purpose",
  "description": "Analyze conversation for unwanted behaviors",
  "prompt": "You are analyzing a coding assistant conversation to find behaviors the user wants to prevent.

Read user messages in the current conversation and identify:
1. Explicit requests to avoid something (\"don't do X\", \"stop doing Y\")
2. Corrections or reversions (user fixing Claude's actions)
3. Frustrated reactions (\"why did you do X?\", \"I didn't ask for that\")
4. Repeated issues (same problem multiple times)

For each issue found, extract:
- What tool was used (Bash, Edit, Write, etc.)
- Specific pattern or command
- Why it was problematic
- User's stated reason

Return findings as a structured list with:
- category: Type of issue
- tool: Which tool was involved
- pattern: Regex or literal pattern to match
- context: What happened
- severity: high/medium/low

Focus on the most recent issues (last 20-30 messages). Don't go back further unless explicitly asked."
}
```

### Step 2: Present Findings to User

After gathering behaviors (from arguments or agent), present to user using AskUserQuestion:

**Question 1: Which behaviors to hookify?**
- Header: "Create Rules"
- multiSelect: true
- Options: List each detected behavior (max 4)
  - Label: Short description (e.g., "Block rm -rf")
  - Description: Why it's problematic

**Question 2: For each selected behavior, ask about action:**
- "Should this block the operation or just warn?"
- Options:
  - "Just warn" (action: warn - shows message but allows)
  - "Block operation" (action: block - prevents execution)

**Question 3: Ask for example patterns:**
- "What patterns should trigger this rule?"
- Show detected patterns
- Allow user to refine or add more

### Step 3: Generate Rule Files

For each confirmed behavior, create a `.agent/hookify.{rule-name}.local.md` file:

**Rule naming convention:**
- Use kebab-case
- Be descriptive: `block-dangerous-rm`, `warn-console-log`, `require-tests-before-stop`
- Start with action verb: block, warn, prevent, require

**File format:**
```markdown
---
name: {rule-name}
enabled: true
event: {bash|file|stop|prompt|all}
pattern: {regex pattern}
action: {warn|block}
---

{Message to show Claude when rule triggers}
```

**Action values:**
- `warn`: Show message but allow operation (default)
- `block`: Prevent operation or stop session

**For more complex rules (multiple conditions):**
```markdown
---
name: {rule-name}
enabled: true
event: file
conditions:
  - field: file_path
    operator: regex_match
    pattern: \.env$
  - field: new_text
    operator: contains
    pattern: API_KEY
---

{Warning message}
```

### Step 4: Create Files and Confirm

**IMPORTANT**: Rule files must be created in the current working directory's `.agent/` folder, NOT the plugin directory.

Use the current working directory (where coding assistant was started) as the base path.

1. Check if `.agent/` directory exists in current working directory
   - If not, create it first with: `mkdir -p .agent`

2. Use Write tool to create each `.agent/hookify.{name}.local.md` file
   - Use relative path from current working directory: `.agent/hookify.{name}.local.md`
   - The path should resolve to the project's .agent directory, not the plugin's

3. Show user what was created:
   ```
   Created 3 hookify rules:
   - .agent/hookify.dangerous-rm.local.md
   - .agent/hookify.console-log.local.md
   - .agent/hookify.sensitive-files.local.md

   These rules will trigger on:
   - dangerous-rm: Bash commands matching "rm -rf"
   - console-log: Edits adding console.log statements
   - sensitive-files: Edits to .env or credentials files
   ```

4. Verify files were created in the correct location by listing them

5. Inform user: **"Rules are active immediately - no restart needed!"**

   The hookify hooks are already loaded and will read your new rules on the next tool use.

## Event Types Reference

- **bash**: Matches Bash tool commands
- **file**: Matches Edit, Write, MultiEdit tools
- **stop**: Matches when agent wants to stop (use for completion checks)
- **prompt**: Matches when user submits prompts
- **all**: Matches all events

## Pattern Writing Tips

**Bash patterns:**
- Match dangerous commands: `rm\s+-rf|chmod\s+777|dd\s+if=`
- Match specific tools: `npm\s+install\s+|pip\s+install`

**File patterns:**
- Match code patterns: `console\.log\(|eval\(|innerHTML\s*=`
- Match file paths: `\.env$|\.git/|node_modules/`

**Stop patterns:**
- Check for missing steps: (check transcript or completion criteria)

## Example Workflow

**User says**: "/hookify Don't use rm -rf without asking me first"

**Your response**:
1. Analyze: User wants to prevent rm -rf commands
2. Ask: "Should I block this command or just warn you?"
3. User selects: "Just warn"
4. Create `.agent/hookify.dangerous-rm.local.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: warn-dangerous-rm
   enabled: true
   event: bash
   pattern: rm\s+-rf
   ---

   ⚠️ **Dangerous rm command detected**

   You requested to be warned before using rm -rf.
   Please verify the path is correct.
   ```
5. Confirm: "Created hookify rule. It's active immediately - try triggering it!"

## Important Notes

- **No restart needed**: Rules take effect immediately on the next tool use
- **File location**: Create files in project's `.agent/` directory (current working directory), NOT the plugin's .agent/
- **Regex syntax**: Use Python regex syntax (raw strings, no need to escape in YAML)
- **Action types**: Rules can `warn` (default) or `block` operations
- **Testing**: Test rules immediately after creating them

## Troubleshooting

**If rule file creation fails:**
1. Check current working directory with pwd
2. Ensure `.agent/` directory exists (create with mkdir if needed)
3. Use absolute path if needed: `{cwd}/.agent/hookify.{name}.local.md`
4. Verify file was created with Glob or ls

**If rule doesn't trigger after creation:**
1. Verify file is in project `.agent/` not plugin `.agent/`
2. Check file with Read tool to ensure pattern is correct
3. Test pattern with: `python3 -c "import re; print(re.search(r'pattern', 'test text'))"`
4. Verify `enabled: true` in frontmatter
5. Remember: Rules work immediately, no restart needed

**If blocking seems too strict:**
1. Change `action: block` to `action: warn` in the rule file
2. Or adjust the pattern to be more specific
3. Changes take effect on next tool use

Use TodoWrite to track your progress through the steps.

### Command: `/list`
*Description*: List all configured hookify rules

# List Hookify Rules

**Load hookify:writing-rules skill first** to understand rule format.

Show all configured hookify rules in the project.

## Steps

1. Use Glob tool to find all hookify rule files:
   ```
   pattern: ".agent/hookify.*.local.md"
   ```

2. For each file found:
   - Use Read tool to read the file
   - Extract frontmatter fields: name, enabled, event, pattern
   - Extract message preview (first 100 chars)

3. Present results in a table:

```
## Configured Hookify Rules

| Name | Enabled | Event | Pattern | File |
|------|---------|-------|---------|------|
| warn-dangerous-rm | ✅ Yes | bash | rm\s+-rf | hookify.dangerous-rm.local.md |
| warn-console-log | ✅ Yes | file | console\.log\( | hookify.console-log.local.md |
| check-tests | ❌ No | stop | .* | hookify.require-tests.local.md |

**Total**: 3 rules (2 enabled, 1 disabled)
```

4. For each rule, show a brief preview:
```
### warn-dangerous-rm
**Event**: bash
**Pattern**: `rm\s+-rf`
**Message**: "⚠️ **Dangerous rm command detected!** This command could delete..."

**Status**: ✅ Active
**File**: .agent/hookify.dangerous-rm.local.md
```

5. Add helpful footer:
```
---

To modify a rule: Edit the .local.md file directly
To disable a rule: Set `enabled: false` in frontmatter
To enable a rule: Set `enabled: true` in frontmatter
To delete a rule: Remove the .local.md file
To create a rule: Use `hookify` command

**Remember**: Changes take effect immediately - no restart needed
```

## If No Rules Found

If no hookify rules exist:

```
## No Hookify Rules Configured

You haven't created any hookify rules yet.

To get started:
1. Use `hookify` to analyze conversation and create rules
2. Or manually create `.agent/hookify.my-rule.local.md` files
3. See `hookify:help` for documentation

Example:
```
/hookify Warn me when I use console.log
```

Check `PLUGIN_ROOT/examples/` for example rule files.
```

## Specialized Subagent Personas

### Persona: `conversation-analyzer`
*Description*: Use this agent when analyzing conversation transcripts to find behaviors worth preventing with hooks. Examples: <example>Context: User is running /hookify command without arguments\nuser: "/hookify"\nassistant: "I'll analyze the conversation to find behaviors you want to prevent"\n<commentary>The /hookify command without arguments triggers conversation analysis to find unwanted behaviors.</commentary></example><example>Context: User wants to create hooks from recent frustrations\nuser: "Can you look back at this conversation and help me create hooks for the mistakes you made?"\nassistant: "I'll use the conversation-analyzer agent to identify the issues and suggest hooks."\n<commentary>User explicitly asks to analyze conversation for mistakes that should be prevented.</commentary></example>

You are a conversation analysis specialist that identifies problematic behaviors in coding assistant sessions that could be prevented with hooks.

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. Read and analyze user messages to find frustration signals
2. Identify specific tool usage patterns that caused issues
3. Extract actionable patterns that can be matched with regex
4. Categorize issues by severity and type
5. Provide structured findings for hook rule generation

**Analysis Process:**

### 1. Search for User Messages Indicating Issues

Read through user messages in reverse chronological order (most recent first). Look for:

**Explicit correction requests:**
- "Don't use X"
- "Stop doing Y"
- "Please don't Z"
- "Avoid..."
- "Never..."

**Frustrated reactions:**
- "Why did you do X?"
- "I didn't ask for that"
- "That's not what I meant"
- "That was wrong"

**Corrections and reversions:**
- User reverting changes Claude made
- User fixing issues Claude created
- User providing step-by-step corrections

**Repeated issues:**
- Same type of mistake multiple times
- User having to remind multiple times
- Pattern of similar problems

### 2. Identify Tool Usage Patterns

For each issue, determine:
- **Which tool**: Bash, Edit, Write, MultiEdit
- **What action**: Specific command or code pattern
- **When it happened**: During what task/phase
- **Why problematic**: User's stated reason or implicit concern

**Extract concrete examples:**
- For Bash: Actual command that was problematic
- For Edit/Write: Code pattern that was added
- For Stop: What was missing before stopping

### 3. Create Regex Patterns

Convert behaviors into matchable patterns:

**Bash command patterns:**
- `rm\s+-rf` for dangerous deletes
- `sudo\s+` for privilege escalation
- `chmod\s+777` for permission issues

**Code patterns (Edit/Write):**
- `console\.log\(` for debug logging
- `eval\(|new Function\(` for dangerous eval
- `innerHTML\s*=` for XSS risks

**File path patterns:**
- `\.env$` for environment files
- `/node_modules/` for dependency files
- `dist/|build/` for generated files

### 4. Categorize Severity

**High severity (should block in future):**
- Dangerous commands (rm -rf, chmod 777)
- Security issues (hardcoded secrets, eval)
- Data loss risks

**Medium severity (warn):**
- Style violations (console.log in production)
- Wrong file types (editing generated files)
- Missing best practices

**Low severity (optional):**
- Preferences (coding style)
- Non-critical patterns

- Message: "Dangerous rm command detected. Verify path before proceeding."

---

### Issue 2: Console.log in TypeScript
**Severity**: Medium
**Tool**: Edit/Write
**Pattern**: `console\.log\(`
**Occurrences**: 2 times
**Context**: Added console.log statements to production TypeScript files

## Summary

Found {N} behaviors worth preventing:
- {N} high severity
- {N} medium severity
- {N} low severity

Recommend creating rules for high and medium severity issues.
```

**Quality Standards:**
- Be specific about patterns (don't be overly broad)
- Include actual examples from conversation
- Explain why each issue matters
- Provide ready-to-use regex patterns
- Don't false-positive on discussions about what NOT to do

**Edge Cases:**

**User discussing hypotheticals:**
- "What would happen if I used rm -rf?"
- Don't treat as problematic behavior

**Teaching moments:**
- "Here's what you shouldn't do: ..."
- Context indicates explanation, not actual problem

**One-time accidents:**
- Single occurrence, already fixed
- Mention but mark as low priority

**Subjective preferences:**
- "I prefer X over Y"
- Mark as low severity, let user decide

**Return Results:**
Provide your analysis in the structured format above. The /hookify command will use this to:
1. Present findings to user
2. Ask which rules to create
3. Generate .local.md configuration files
4. Save rules to .agent directory

## 🔒 Hookify Cognitive Execution

Before executing any tools or modifying files, you MUST cognitively scan the workspace for Hookify rule files matching `.agent/hookify.*.local.md`.
For any matching rules:
1. Inspect the defined regex patterns and trigger conditions.
2. Verify that your planned tool execution or edits do not violate these rules.
3. Alternatively, execute the rule engine script to programmatically validate compliance:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/rule_engine.py
   ```
